    <h1>Welcome to the HTML Elements Assessment</h1>
    <p>This document demonstrates the basic structure of an HTML document including the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, and the use of <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.</p>

</html>
<!--
Explanation:
<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document type and version of HTML being used.

<html>: Root element of the HTML document.

<head>: Contains metadata, title, and links to stylesheets or scripts.

<title>: Sets the title of the document, displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

<body>: Contains the content of the HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, and other elements.

This basic structure is the foundation for any HTML document, ensuring it is properly formatted and recognizable by web browsers.
